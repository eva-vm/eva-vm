# Eva (Virtual Machine)

Eva is a virtual machine made by students for students. Light and simple, it offers a well-adapted experimentation sandbox to lean assembly or writing compilers. Its well-maintained and documented source code allows the project to be accessible by many, and can be easily modified and hacked upon. Eva is programmable in an assembly code made specifically for the project, boasting a concise yet simple instruction set. Furthermore, Eva's implementation as well as its assembly code is easily reproducible in any language.

# Why Eva?

## 1 - SIMPLICITY

Eva was designed with a "back to basics" mentality. In other words, the project skips the superfluous and goes straight to the essentials by proposing an instruction set that's short and simple to implement. This simplicity makes Eva an excellent starting point to learn how a computer system works, or to serve as a target platform in writing a first compiler.

## 2 - PORTABILITY

Eva is implemented in C99, and only depends on SDL to manage the graphical output. This choice ensures the source code stays as portable as possible, allowing people to compile and use the project wherever they need.

## 3 - RELIABILITY

From its small source code size, the rigor put into its implementation and its minimalistic aspect, Eva is powerfully reliable. Such characteristics garant a high level of stability and maintainability of the source code. Furthermore the development team will always prioritize security and bug correction above implementing new features.

## 4 - FREEDOM

Finally, Eva is FOSS! Distributed under the MIT license, anyone can use its source code, hack onto it, or add new functionality. Don't heitate to tell us about what you use Eva for, or to issue a Pull Request to propose changes!
